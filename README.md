# webscrapping
The repository contains a code for web scrapping. During my internship at Autocar India, I developed this algorithm which can 
collect all the car and bike news, their number of views and date of the news from the Autocar website. The code is written in Python and I have used following libraries of Python:
BeautifulSoup, requests, xlswriter, re, lxml.html.clean

The code collects all the news from specified page numbers of the Autocar website, exports the data to an excel sheet.
